# specflow-to-markdown-sample
Sample project using [SpecFlowToMarkdown tool](https://github.com/gman-au/specflow-to-markdown/tree/v6.0.8)

## Tips
* Don't include the test library name (e.g. `NUnit`, `Xunit`) as part of the delcared project namespaces (e.g. `My.NUnit.Tests`) as this will introduce build failures
